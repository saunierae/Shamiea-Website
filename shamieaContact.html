<h2>About Me</h2>   
 
    <p>I have always found modeling to be a fun and creative way to capture a moment. A photograph can capture so many things at once. You have the person in the picture, the objects around the person, and the feelings that person expresses. There are so many specific details that are focused on just to capture that one moment.</p>
 
    <p>The moment I found out that modeling was a passion of mine was when a local photography student called me up and said she needed a model that would pose for her so she could practice photography. I of course said yes. I then called a local MUA student and told her we needed to get to work because I needed her to do hair and makeup. The next morning we woke bright and early and started on this new adventure. Not knowing where it would lead us. At this moment we created a team. The three of us would plan and work together to create beautiful photographs in the hope of capturing a moment that would inspire and empower others to go after their dreams.</p>
 
    <p>After this amazing day together we have done several more photo shoots and every time we have tried to step up our game. It has become more difficult because of the demands of our every days lives but we are always planning our next gathering so we can produce something new and exciting. </p>
